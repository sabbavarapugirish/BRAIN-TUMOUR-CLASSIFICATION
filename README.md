# BRAIN-TUMOUR-CLASSIFICATION
The goal of the project is to build an automatic and effective brain tumor MRI image classification method based on Deep Learning to assist physicians in decision-making.
The primary goal of project is to categorize the tumors into four different classes using the most accurate methodology. The classification of the tumors needs CNN models. 
It categorize the tumors into four different classes using the most accurate methodology. The classification of the tumors needs CNN models. 
I have chosen the CNN models depending on its performance in terms of accuracy and loss.
Finally, I have developed a tumor detection system for the accurate classification of tumors based on which the doctors can plan an effective treatment for the patient.
